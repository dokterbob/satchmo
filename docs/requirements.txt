Requirements
============

Satchmo is based on the Django framework, therefore you do need a fully functioning
Django instance to use Satchmo.  The `Django installation guide`_ will step you
through the process.

As of now, it is recommended that you use a Django version from the current trunk.
Some of the most recent features in Satchmo require a recent (0.97-pre) checkout
from svn.  A known good version of Django can be found in the `snapshot`_ directory.

Satchmo requires Python 2.3 or later and a database supported by Django.

There are a number of other Python packages that are required for usage of all the
features in Satchmo.

- `Python Imaging Library`_
- `Elementtree`_ (included in Python 2.5+)
- `Python cryptography toolkit`_ (`Windows binary`_)
- `ReportLab`_
- `Tiny RML2PDF`_ (`download link`_)

There are also a number of other Django packages (mentioned below) that you will require

For product comment functionality, you will need:

- `django-comment-utils`_ which must be on your PYTHONPATH

For the account registration process, you will need:

- `Django Registration`_

A valid Django cache backend (file, memcached or DB) is required for the config settings.

The following package is required to load the initial data and run the unit tests:

- `PyYaml`_

Docutils is useful for auto generating some documentation:

- `Docutils`_
