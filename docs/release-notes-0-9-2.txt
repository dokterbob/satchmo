Migration Notes
---------------

CSRF
++++
As of `rev 1999 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/a624c8018f52>`_, Satchmo supports the newest Django 1.2 Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
protection. You are encouraged to read more about it int the `Django docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/>`_

If you have an existing Satchmo store and need to support CSRF, you will need to do a couple of things:

    1. Upgrade to Django 1.2.3 or greater
    2. Ensure 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
    3. Ensure that any forms in your custom templates, have {% csrf_token %} inside the <form> element
    
Messages
++++++++
As of `rev 1999 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/a624c8018f52>`_, Satchmo incorporates some of the components of the new `messages framework <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/messages/>`_.

If you have an existing Satchmo store you will need to:

    1. Add 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware' to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
    2. Add 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages' to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
    3. Add 'django.contrib.messages' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting
    
Protx Payment Module Renamed
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As of `rev 2051 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/04f821df32ec>`_, the Protx module has been renamed to Sage Pay. You will need to manually copy over your former Protx credentials to
the new Sage Pay module. No further changes should be necessary.
