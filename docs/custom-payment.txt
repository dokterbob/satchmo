Custom Payment Modules
======================

While Satchmo currently has support for several different payment modules, you may
have unique needs or the desire to create your own payment processor module. This
document will discuss how to create your own payment modules.  If you do decide
to create your own module, please let us know so we can include it back into the
satchmo core and make the framework that much more robust.

Overview
--------

Satchmo's payment processor modules are meant to be as modular as possible.  For
many types of payment processors, you should be able to use one of the existing 
modules as a basis for creating your own.

All of the modules are stored in the ``/payment/modules`` directory.  If you take a 
quick look at any one of the subdirectories, you will see a number of files:
 
 - __init__.py
 - config.py
 - processor.py
 - urls.py
 - views.py
 
The ``__init__.py`` is required so that satchmo can import the files.  There is no need
to put any code in this file.  Just be sure it exists!

The rest of the files are described below.

Building your processor
-----------------------

The ``processor.py`` file is where the majority of the heavy lifting is done.  The processor
does 4 things:

 - Sets up its configuration for the service (``__init__``)
 - Takes order data and formats it in the appropriate manner (``prepareData``)
 - Sends the data to the processing server/url (``process``)
 - Returns the results (``process``)
 
Optionally, the processor can include include test code so that it is easy to verify from
the command line.

Here is a stub you can use to create your own processor::


    class PaymentProcessor(object):

        def __init__(self, settings):
            # Set up your configuration for items like
            # Test server, url, various flags and settings
            
        def prepareData(self, data):
            # data will contain an order object
            # use this data to create the unique string that will
            # be sent to the payment processor
            
        def process(self):
            # Send the data via the appropriate manner
            # and False if not.  Include an error message to display if it fails
            # Be sure to return True if successful
        

Refer to the authorize.net, cybersource or trustcommerce modules for various examples to
help you through the process.

Configuration
-------------

Each processor will have unique variables that need to be set.  The ``config.py`` file is where
you can leverage the Satchmo settings capability to add your unique variables.  Please 
refer to the `configuation documentation </trac/wiki/ConfigurationSystem>`_ in order to understand 
how the system works. For more examples, the existing working modules are great examples of what to 
setup.  The basic format is:

Add the new module into the existing payment modules and give it a name::

    PAYMENT_MODULES = config_get('PAYMENT', 'MODULES')
    PAYMENT_MODULES.add_choice(('PAYMENT_MYNEWPROCESSOR', 'MyNewProcessor'))
    
Create the new configuration group::

    PAYMENT_GROUP = ConfigurationGroup('PAYMENT_MYNEWPROCESSOR',
    _('My New Processor Payment Settings'),
    requires=PAYMENT_MODULES,
    ordering=102)
    
Now register the settings you need::

    config_register([

        StringValue(PAYMENT_GROUP,
            'KEY',
            description=_("Module key"),
            hidden=True,
            default = 'MYNEWPROCESSOR'),

        ModuleValue(PAYMENT_GROUP,
            'MODULE',
            description=_('Implementation module'),
            hidden=True,
            default = 'satchmo.payment.modules.mynewprocessor'),
            
        BooleanValue(PAYMENT_GROUP, 
            'SSL', 
            description=_("Use SSL for the checkout pages?"), 
            default=False),
        
        
        BooleanValue(PAYMENT_GROUP, 
            'LIVE', 
            description=_("Accept real payments"),
            help_text=_("False if you want to be in test mode"),
            default=False),
        
        StringValue(PAYMENT_GROUP,
            'LABEL',
            description=_('English name for this group on the checkout screens'),
            default = 'Credit Cards',
            help_text = _('This will be passed to the translation utility')),

        StringValue(PAYMENT_GROUP,
            'URL_BASE',
            description=_('The url base used for constructing urlpatterns which will use this module'),
            default = r'^credit/'),

        MultipleStringValue(PAYMENT_GROUP,
            'CREDITCHOICES',
            description=_('Available credit cards'),
            choices = (
                (('Amex', 'American Express')),
                (('Visa','Visa')),
                (('Mastercard','Mastercard')),
                (('Discover','Discover'))),
            default = ('Visa', 'Mastercard', 'Discover')),
        

        StringValue(PAYMENT_GROUP, 
            'PASSWORD', 
            description=_('Your Processor password'),
            default="")  

    ])

All of these settings can be accessed in your ``__init__`` method (shown above).  
For example, the LIVE value above can be accessed by using ``settings.LIVE.value``

In order to enable your new payment processor, you must add it to the CUSTOM_PAYMENT_MODULES variable
in your local_settings.py::

    # register custom external payment modules by listing their modules here
    # ex: CUSTOM_NEWSLETTER_MODULES = ['client.payment.wondercharge',]
    CUSTOM_PAYMENT_MODULES = ['custom.payment.mynewprocessor']


Views
-----

Most payment processing have similar steps:

 - Collect demographic information
 - Collect payment information
 - Confirm info is correct
 - Return a status
 

The ``views.py`` file contains the information that maps your processor views to the existing
views or your own custom view.  

For most people, the views contained in payment.common.views will be sufficient.  The example below
maps these views to views already available in Satchmo::

    from satchmo.configuration import config_get_group
    from satchmo.payment.common.views import confirm, payship
        
    def pay_ship_info(request):
        return payship.credit_pay_ship_info(request, config_get_group('PAYMENT_MYNEWPROCESSOR'))
        
    def confirm_info(request):
        return confirm.credit_confirm_info(request, config_get_group('PAYMENT_MYNEWPROCESSOR'))


However, there is nothing stopping you from creating your own view::

    def confirm_info(request):
        # Do a lot of custom stuff here
        return render_to_response(template, context)
        

All of the current satchmo payment views are in ``/payment/common/views``
Please review these before trying to build one of your own!

Url configuration
-----------------

Now that you have built your processor, configured your settings and built your views, you
need to tell Satchmo how to access these views.  This is where the ``urls.py`` file is useful.

For most processors, a simple file would look like this::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from satchmo.configuration import config_value, config_get_group


    config = config_get_group('PAYMENT_MYNEWPROCESSOR')

    urlpatterns = patterns('satchmo',
         (r'^$', 'payment.modules.myprocessor.views.pay_ship_info', {'SSL':config.SSL.value}, 'MYNEWPROCESSOR_satchmo_checkout-step2'),
         (r'^confirm/$', 'payment.modules.trustcommerce.views.confirm_info', {'SSL':config.SSL.value}, 'MYNEWPROCESSOR_satchmo_checkout-step3'),
         (r'^success/$', 'payment.common.views.checkout.success', {'SSL':config.SSL.value}, 'MYNEWPROCESSOR_satchmo_checkout-success'),
    )
    

The nice thing about this file is that it allows you to easily plug in the views you need and rename the urls
to whatever form you need.  Just make sure to maintain the naming convention for the urls as shown above.

Conclusion
----------

Hopefully this document will help you get started in creating your own payment modules.  Before trying to tackle
one on your own, take some time to look at the existing models and get a feel for how things have been done.  Once
you are comfortable, I suggest copying one of the modules and using it as a starting point for your subsequent
efforts.  If you get stuck, please feel free to as the list for help.
