Products
========

The core of any online store is the product  you are selling.  Some people may have very simple needs for categorizing and describing their products, 
while others may have much more complex needs.  Satchmo's product framework tries to strike a balance, enabling easy product configuration but supporting 
complex products if your needs demand.

Categories
----------

Out of the box, Satchmo supports the traditional hierarchical method for categorizing products.  In other words, you can create category trees like this:

 * Movies

   - Action
   - Western
   - Comedy
   - Black and White

     + Foreign
     + English
     + Silent

 * Books

   - Fiction
   - Non-fiction
    
Some things to keep in mind with Satchmo's implementation:

 * You are not limited to the number of categories or the depth of categories.
 * You are allowed to add products to 1 or more product categories
 
When entering a category in the admin interface, you will have several fields to fill in.  Below is a description of each field and how it is used:

Name
    The name of this specific category.  It is the text seen by the user to describe this category.  In the example above, Movies, Action, etc. are all names.
    
Slug
    This is a prepopulated field that is used in the url to identify the category.  One aspect that Django encourages is well designed urls.  The slug field is commonly used so that a url "makes sense" when you look at it.  The nice side effect of this is that in some cases, search engines will give higher ranking for sites with cleaner urls.
    
Parent
    If a category is at the top of the tree, then there is no parent.  In our example above, Movies and Books have no parents.  While Action, Comedy, Black and White would all have Movies as a parent.
    
Meta
    When an HTML page is constructed, certain meta information can be added to the page which makes it easier for search engines to classify your pages and your products.  This field is used to enter information about your category that may not be readily seen by just looking at a description.
    
Description
    This is a free form field that describes this category.  You can use this to help guide users in your site.  It's also helpful for search engines.
    
Product
-------

A Product is the main focus of your store.  It is the "thing" that a person going to your store would see.  There are many fields you can use to configure your Items.

Category
    See the description above.  This is where you choose one or more categories where a person could find this product.
    
Name
    This is the full name of an product.  Think of it as the title of the product.
    
Slug
    This is similar to the slug field in category.  It is a brief description of the item that will show up in the url and uniquely identify this product.
    
Description
    Free form text fields that tell a potential customer about this item and why they may want to purchase it.

Short_description
    This is meant for a brief 1 or 2 line description that can be shown by your templates on the product category pages and similar places.

Date_added
    The date you added this product to your store.  It could be useful for showing a list of new products.
    
Active
    A flag to identify which items are still valid in the store.  If you decide you don't want to show an item for purchase, I recommend making it Active=False instead of trying to delete it.
    
Featured
    Another flag which can be used to identify special items that you may want to highlight in your site. In the default templates, featured items show-up on the front page of the store.
    
items in stock
    The inventory of this specific item.

Meta
    This meta field is similar to the one described above in the category.  It's basically some additional descriptive language you might want to include in your HTML that does not already show up in the description.
    
Weight, Length and Height
    These dimensions are for your use in displaying the item's info. It can also be used for shipping calculations.

Taxable
    A flag to tell whether or not tax should be calculated for this product.  More information on taxes can be found ...
    
Tax_class
    Allows you to set the rate at which tax is calculated.

Related_items
    Certain products may naturally be grouped together.  If you were to purchase a movie, you might want to include links to the book based on the movie or maybe a movie poster.  This would be the place to record those linkages.
    
Also_purchased
    Another field to show relationships between products.  This can be useful if you want to try to increase sales by showing what others have purchased when they bought this product.
    
Price
    An item has multiple ways to determine a price.  For a simple single-price all the time item, just enter a price with a "Discount Quantity" of 1, and a blank "Expires" date.  More detailed options are spelled out in the Price and ConfigurableProduct sections below.

Images
    Add an image to your product, see Images section below.

Product Subtypes
    There's a variety of ways that the behavior of a product can be expanded. These additional, optional, features are shown as product SubTypes. The most commonly used of these will be ConfigurableProduct which allows you to have options on your product such as Sizes: Small/Medium/Large, Colors, etc. For more details on the Product SubTypes look in the applicable sections below.

Product Attributes
++++++++++++++++++

In some cases, you may want to have certain product information stored in the database.  For instance, you might want to have "number of pages" or "ISBN" fields
for all of the books in your store.  Attributes allow you to associate arbitrary data with your products via name, value pairs.

Price
+++++

The final choice you have with your products is if there is additional pricing you would like to apply for bulk or special discounts.  For instance, you may want to charge someone $10 for 1-5 shirts but only $7 if they order 6 or more.  This model allows you to do such configuration.

Price
    Override the price for this sub item if it meets one of the other criteria identified below.
    
Quantity
    The number of items needed to qualify for the price change.
    
Expires
    Date when this offer is no longer valid.  This can be used for various promotions.

Images
++++++

In addition to the information discussed above, you can add as many images as you would like to your item.  One of the nice things about the way Satchmo handles these images is that they are automatically converted to thumbnails and are cached so that the conversion process does not slow down your web site.

Images only have a couple of fields:

Picture
    This is the image of your item that you upload to the web server.  The actual thumbnail size is set in your templates.
    
Caption
    A description of this image.  This field may be used to describe the different angles that images show.
    
Sort
    If you would like control of the order in which the images are displayed, this field can be used.  This field is also special in that it must be filled in!  If you want to delete an image from your item, you must delete the value in the sort field and save the image!

Item Options
------------

As discussed above, an item is the central focus of your store.  For many cases, the items in your store may have several options.  For instance, if you sell t-shirts, a visitor to your store should be able to choose the size of the shirt while looking at the main item.  You may also want them to choose a color, style and/or a bunch of other different options.  The challenge with this much flexibility is building something that is easy for the user to understnad and easy for the store administrator to maintain.  Satchmo uses option groups and options to create configurable products and product variants.

Option Groups
+++++++++++++

Continuing on with the shirt example, you will probably end up with some similar options that you want to apply to a large number of products.  For instance, all of your shirts are going to have sizes of Small, Medium and Large.  Instead of adding all three of these to each item, you can create an option group and add that grouping to the item.  Maintenance is much easier this way.

Here are the fields in the option groups:

Name
    A description of the group.  This is displayed in the product page to describe the choices available to the user.  In our shirt instance, "size" would be appropriate.
    
Description
    This field is used for administrative purposes.  Size may make sense when looking at a product but what if you have shirts, shoes and hats?  How do you know which group these sizes apply to?  Use this field to write details about the size.  For instance, you could have an option group with the description "Shirt Sizes", "Hat Sizes" and "Shoe Sizes."
    
Sort Order
    This helps you order the options in the way you would like them displayed.  For instance, you may want colors to show before sizes.

Options
++++++++++++

In our example, if an option group is size, then the options would be "small", "medium" or "large."  The nice thing about these options is that you can configure these to change the price of your product.  If a large shirt costs more than a small shirt, then you can assign the incremental cost to the "large" option item and the correct price will be shown in the users cart and order.

Name
    This is the displayed value of the option.  You may want to show people "Small" but only store "S" in the database.  
    
Value
    Corresponds with the Name above.  In this example, the value would be "S."
    
Price Change
    If you would like this option to modify the Item's price, enter a positive or negative number here.


Configurable Products
+++++++++++++++++++++

ConfigurableProduct is a modifier for a product that allows you to associate an OptionGroup with a particular Product.

Option group
    This is a collection of descriptions that identify this item.  See more details below.
    
Create_Variations
    This is a special option that allows you to create ProductVariations.

Variations
    Variations are all Products that are never displayed directly to a customer, but represent the actual product as you would have it on the shelf.  For example, if your ConfigurableProduct is a t-shirt, then you will probably have ProductVariations for "Large Green t-shirt", "Small Blue t-shirt", etc.  It's easiest to have these generated for you using the create_variations option above, but once they are created, you can edit these individually to do things such as set a different price for the XL shirt.
    
Product Variations
++++++++++++++++++

As described above a ProductVariation can be thought of as the actual product you maintain in inventory and sell to a customer.  It is an item with all of the options applied.  In our example case, it might be a Large, White Shirt. The ProductVariation object itself only has links between a ConfigurableProduct, and a Product.

Downloadable Product
++++++++++++++++++++

A downloadable product is a virtual product that will be electronically delivered to a customer after the purchase is completed.  In Satchmo, this is accomplished by sending a unique url to a customer after the purchase.  This url can be restricted so that the possibility of multiple downloads is minimized.  Depending on your product you may want to add additional security controls but that is outside the scope of Satchmo.

In order to use a downloadable product, you need to make sure you have a Product created as described above.  Also, make sure that you have the Downloadable Product type enabled in the configuration settings.

From the Product detail page, choose "Add Downloadable Product"

This screen will allow you to upload your file and specifiy the number of allowed downloads, the number of minutes it will remain active and a final flag for whether or not the file is still active.  After saving the changes, the product will be enabled for downloading.

In order for the downloadable product to be secured, you must make sure that your web server supports the x-send-file header.  Both Apache and lighttpd do but you'll need to refer to the web server documentation for details.  Lighttpd natively supports this but Apache needs mod_xsendfile to work correctly.

In addition to configuring the x-send-file header, you will need to ensure that the protected directory can not be browsed to directly.  An example lighttpd configuration is::

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/static/protected/" {
    url.access-deny = ("")
    }   

Custom Product
++++++++++++++
A custom product is one that is typically assembled or made to order based on the customer's needs. A common situation is a computer configurator that allows a customer to tailor the computer to their needs. Once the order is submitted the store owner will then build or configure that product. 

Once you have created a product as described above, you may wish to use it as a basis for a custom product. The most important additional information you need to associate with your product is the option groups or custom text fields the customer may use to create their product. The option groups are no different from the ones described above. This gives you tremendous flexibility to vary the price of the product based on the chosen options. The custom text fields are free form text fields meant to capture special notes or instructions related to the order.

One unique aspect of the custom product is that you can elect to charge only a certain percentage at the time the order is placed. If you choose a percent downpayment then only that amount will be charged when the order is completed. If you choose 100%, then the entire price will be charged at checkout.

The final unique aspect is that you can elect to defer shipping charges on the order. If you are creating a very unique product, you may wish to have that discussion with the customer when you are collecting the full payment.

The custom product does not create product variations. The downside of this is that you must manage your inventory yourself but the upside is that you don't have all of those different configurations in your store. Feel free to play around with both products and see which one meets your needs the best.

Subscription Product
++++++++++++++++++++
A subscription product is a product type that can be used to manage recurring billing memberships or to add payment terms to a non-membership product.

In order to use this product,make sure you have the Subscription Product type enabled in the configuration settings. Additionally, if you would like to use a url to activate the rebilling, you will need to make sure the the setting ALLOW_URL_REBILL is set to True. If you do set it to tru, make sure that you add a new unique key in the CRON_KEY setting.

To use a subscription product, you need to setup a base Product as described in the sections above.  The price you set for the base product will be the amount that is charged to your customer periodically based on your subscription schedule

In order to use this product type, from the Product detail page, choose Add Subscription Product.

On this screen, you will enter your subscription payment terms as described below.

Recurring Billing
    Select this if you want your customer to be charged the regular product price on a repeating schedule

Recurring Times
    Enter an integer here to limit the number of times your customer will be charged. (ie only 10 easy payment of $9.95)

Duration
    Enter the number of days between each billing cycle.

Shippable?
    The shipping charges, if any, that will be charged to your customer.

Trial Terms:
    Use this section to add trial pricing to your product (ie only $4.95 for the first 7 days, then $29.95 a month thereafter).
        
        Price:  The price of the trial period.  Enter 0 for a free trial, or a decimal number for a non-free trial (ie 9.94)
        Trial Duration: The number of days the trial will last. Leave both price and trial duration blank if you do not want to add a trial.

    Important Note About Trials:
        You can add as many trial periods as you wish, unless you are using paypal as a payment option.  PayPal can only accept 2 trial periods.  If you are using PayPal, do not add more than 2 trial periods!

Cronjob:
In order for recurring billing to work, you need to setup a cronjob on your server to run once a day (preferably in the middle of the night).  Use settings similar to these:

    0 23 * * * /usr/bin/lynx -source http://yourdomain.com/shop/checkout/cron/?key=YOURPASSKEY
    You will need to set the CRON_KEY variable in your settings file to your desired passphrase.

Alternatively, you can run the rebilling script as a shell script.  In that case, your cron job would look like this:
    0 23 * * * sh /path/to/satchmo/rebilling_cron.sh
    If you use this method, make sure to edit the path on the first line of rebilling_cron.sh to point to the directory containing the script.


A short tutorial
----------------

Here is a quick step by step overview for adding something to your store.  Hopefully it illustrates how to add products and use the concepts described above.

 - From the admin interface, add a new individual Product
 - Choose the appropriate Category, Name, etc.  For illustration purposes, create a Satchmo Developer Book  
 - Be sure to put in a value for the price ($25.00) with no expiration or quantity.  Then click save
 - You should see a list of all your products
 - Click on the Satchmo Developer Book
 - At the bottom of your screen, you'll see the option to "Add ConfigurableProduct"  
 - Click on the link
 - Select the appropriate Option Group (Book Type) and click Save & Continue Editing
 - Check "Create Variations" and Click the save button

You've now created all the Product Variants for the Satchmo Developer
Handbook.  If you want to tweak specific ProductVariants you can but you
don't have to.
