Signals in Satchmo
==================

Signals are a very powerful tool available in Django that allows you to decouple aspects of your application. The `Django Signals Documentation`_, has this summary:
   
    "In a nutshell, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place."

In addition to all of the built in `Django signals`_, Satchmo includes a number of store related signals. By using these signals, you can add very unique customizations to your store without needing to modify the Satchmo code.

-------------

    Usage::

        import myviews
        
        satchmo_cart_add_complete.connect(myviews.cart_add_listener, sender=None)


Example - Putting it All Together
---------------------------------

This section contains a brief example of how to use signals in your application.
For this example, we want to have certain products that are only available to members.
Everyone can see the products, but only members can add to the cart. If
a non-member tries to purchase a product, they will get a clear error
message letting them know they need to be a member.

The first thing to do is create a `listeners.py` file in your app. In this case,
the file would look something like this::

    """
    A custom listener that will evaluate whether or not the product being added
    to the cart is available to the current user based on their membership.
    """
    from satchmo_store.shop.exceptions import CartAddProhibited
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    class ContactCannotOrder(CartAddProhibited):
        def __init__(self, contact, product, msg):
            super(ContactCannotOrder, self).__init__(product, msg)
            self.contact = contact

    def veto_for_non_members(sender, cartitem=None, added_quantity=0, **kwargs):
        from utils import can_user_buy
        customer = kwargs['cart'].customer
        if can_user_buy(cartitem.product, customer):
            return True
        else:
            msg = _("Only members are allowed to purchase this product.")
            raise ContactCannotOrder(customer, cartitem.product, msg)
            
Next, you need to create the `can_user_buy` function. Your `utils.py` file could
look something like this (details left up to the reader)::

    def can_user_buy(product, contact=None):
        """  
        Given a product and a user, return True if that person can buy it and
        False if they can not.
        This doesn't work as it stands now. You'll need to customize the
        is_member function
        """
        if is_member(contact):
            return True
        else:
            return False

The final step is to make sure your new listener is hooked up. In your `models.py`
add the following code::

    from listeners import veto_for_non_members
    from satchmo_store.shop import signals
        
    signals.satchmo_cart_add_verify.connect(veto_for_non_members, sender=None)


Now, you should be able to restrict certain products to only your members. 
The nice thing is that you've done this withouth modifying your satchmo
base code.
