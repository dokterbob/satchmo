===============================
Installation - SVN Version Only
===============================

This guide is the new (and hopefully improved) Satchmo installation process. It is meant to be a cookbook
approach for most users. Advanced users can modify to integrate into their own projects.

This guide assumes you are working on a unix variant and that you are installing it somewhere into a directory
you have write access to. In the below example, we use /home/user/src. You are expected to modify the path to fit your needs.

.. warning::
   You must have a recent SVN version of Django properly installed and all of the
   dependencies mentioned in the requirements section properly installed.

Installing Satchmo into your path
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Use django to create your new store::

        cd /home/user/src
        django-admin.py startproject mystore

2. Checkout the latest Satchmo svn release into (/home/user/src) ::

        svn co svn://satchmoproject.com/satchmo/trunk/ satchmo-trunk

3. Install satchmo into your site-packages directory::

        cd /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk
        sudo python setup.py install

4. Once the above step is completed, you should be able to import both django and satchmo::

        $ python
        Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Mar 12 2008, 13:39:09) 
        [GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu4)] on linux2
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> import django
        >>> import satchmo
        >>> 

.. warning::
   Do not attempt to progress any further on the install until the above imports work.
   
   
Customizing the settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now, you need to customize the settings.py file in mystore to include the relevant satchmo information. A sample file called settings-customize.py is available to act as a template. You may choose
to copy this file and use as a template for settings.py or use the notes below to configure your existing one. Please remember to ensure that your Django database connections and settings are 
working properly before trying to add any pieces of satchmo.

5. Ensure that /home/user/src/my-store/settings.py has the following satchmo-specific configurations (in addition to the defaults and your other app needs)::

        import os
        DIRNAME = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        LOCAL_DEV = True
        
        MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'static/')
        
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ("django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",  "satchmo.shop.SSLMiddleware.SSLRedirect")
        TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.path.join(DIRNAME, "templates"))
        TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = 	('satchmo.shop.context_processors.settings',
                                                                    'django.core.context_processors.auth',)

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'django.contrib.admin',
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'django.contrib.sessions',
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'django.contrib.comments',
                'comment_utils',
                'django.contrib.sitemaps',
                'satchmo.caching',
                'satchmo.configuration',
                'satchmo.shop',
                'satchmo.contact',
                'satchmo.product',
                'satchmo.shipping',
                'satchmo.payment',
                'satchmo.discount',
                'satchmo.giftcertificate',
                'satchmo.supplier',
                'satchmo.thumbnail',
                'satchmo.l10n',
                'satchmo.tax',
                )
                
        AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
            'satchmo.accounts.email-auth.EmailBackend',
            )

        # Load the local settings
        from local_settings import *
        
6. Copy the local_settings file to mystore::

        cp /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk/satchmo/local_settings-customize.py /home/user/src/mystore/local_settings.py
        
7. You will need to verify the values assigned to the following items in local_settings.py::

        SITE_NAME
        CACHE_BACKEND
        CACHE_TIMEOUT
        SITE_DOMAIN
        SHOP_BASE
        LOGDIR
        LOGFILE
        
Copy the rest of the required files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

8. Next, you need to configure your urls.py file::

        python manage.py satchmo_copy_urls

9. You will need to merge the satchmo-urls.py file with the existing urls.py file. For most situations, just copy over::
        
        cp urls.py urls.py.orig
        cp satchmo-urls.py urls.py
        
10. Copy over the static directory::

        python manage.py satchmo_copy_static
        
11. Copy over the default templates::

        python manage.py satchmo_copy_templates

Test and Install the Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
   
12.  Now, you should be ready to go. In order to test your Satchmo setup, execute the following command (from the mystore directory)::

        python manage.py satchmo_check
        Checking your satchmo configuration.
        Your configuration has no errors.
        
If any errors are identified, resolve them based on the error description.

13. Sync the new satchmo tables::

        python manage.py syncdb
        
14. Load the country data stored in the l10n application::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_l10n
        
15. (Optional) Load the demo store data::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_store
        
16. (Optional) Load the US tax table::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_us_tax
		
View the Demo Store
+++++++++++++++++++

17.  Start up the sample webserver to see your store::

        python manage.py runserver
        
17.  In order to see your sample store, point your browser to::
    
        http://localhost/shop

19.  If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::

        http://localhost/admin
        
20.  Many configuration and customization settings are accessed through the url::

        http://localhost/settings

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup.  If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work.  If not, use the appropriate url.

Additional Notes
++++++++++++++++

Satchmo also includes a command that will erase all your tables. It is useful while devoloping but please be careful before using!

.. warning::
    The next step can erase data in the satchmo database. Be sure to have a backup of any critical data.
    
(For development use only)::

        python manage.py delete_all_dbs

Satchmo also includes a full set of unit tests. After you get your system installed, you can run the unit tests with this command::

        python manage.py test
