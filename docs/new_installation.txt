============
Installation
============

This guide is the Satchmo installation process. It is meant to be a cookbook approach for
most users. Advanced users may wish to modify this in order to integrate into their own projects. For the
truly impatient, you may look at the :doc:`Quick Start <quickstart>` for the fastest way to get a store up and
running.

This guide assumes you are working on a unix variant and that you are installing it somewhere into a directory
you have write access to. In the below example, we use /home/user/src. You are expected to modify the path to fit your needs.

.. warning::
   You must have Django 1.1.x properly installed and all of the dependencies mentioned in the requirements_ section properly installed.

The easiest way to install satchmo requirements, is to use the python setuptools program to download egg and tar packages. The next section describes
one simple method to install the dependencies. You may manually install them if you wish.

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

1. Install setuputils by following the instructions on easy_install_ page. After installation, you should be able to run ``easy_install`` directly (assuming the install directory is in you $PATH).

2. Install required dependencies (this may vary based on your OS of choice)::

        easy_install pycrypto
        easy_install http://code.enthought.com/enstaller/eggs/rhel/3/Reportlab-2.1.0001-py2.5.egg
        easy_install http://www.satchmoproject.com/snapshots/trml2pdf-1.2.tar.gz
        easy_install django-registration
        easy_install PyYAML

.. note::
    If you have Python 2.4 installed, you will need to install elementtree also::

        easy_install elementtree

.. warning::
    Not all dependencies are available via ``easy_install``.

3. Install Python Imaging Library. There are multiple options for installing this application. Please use 1 of the options below::

    - Download the binary from the PIL site and install.

    - Use your distributions package manager. For Ubuntu::

        sudo apt-get install python-imaging

    - Use easy_install::

        easy_install --find-links=http://download.zope.org/distribution PILwoTk

4. Install django-threaded-multihost::

   - Download from http://gosatchmo.com/apps/django-threaded-multihost/

   - Unpack or check out and install::

       sudo python setup.py install

5. Install django-app-plugins:

   - You may use the original, but we recommend using the slightly forked version which uses Satchmo's advanced caching system to speed up page loads.

   - Check out the forked version::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-caching-app-plugins/
       cd /path/to/your/site-packages/dir
       ln -s /path/to/django-caching-app-plugins/app_plugins .

6. Install sorl-thumbnail:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone https://sorl-thumbnail.googlecode.com/hg/ sorl-thumbnail
       cd /path/to/your/site-packages/dir
       ln -s /path/to/sorl .

7. Install signals-ahoy:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-signals-ahoy/
       cd /path/to/your/site-packages/dir
       ln -s /path/to/django-signals-ahoy/signals_ahoy

8. Install livesettings:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-livesettings/
       cd /path/to/your/site-packages/dir
       ln -s /path/to/django-livesettings/livesettings


9. Install keyedcache:

   - Check out from source::

       hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-keyedcache/
       cd /path/to/your/site-packages/dir
       ln -s /path/to/django-keyedcache/keyedcache

Satchmo has two types of documentation. Sphinx is used to generate this document.
Docutils are useful for the auto-generated admin documentation. You may choose to
install these dependencies.

10. Optional documentation dependencies::

     easy_install Sphinx
     easy_install docutils

.. note::
    Please note that all dependencies can be installed manually. Please visit the requirements_ page for details. Also, provided egg and tar files may not be the most current installation, so you should ensure that the
    recommended satchmo version is available via ``easy_install`` before proceeding.

Installing Satchmo into your path
---------------------------------

1. Use django to create your new store::

        cd /home/user/src
        django-admin.py startproject mystore

2. Checkout the latest Satchmo release into (/home/user/src)::

        hg clone http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/

.. note::
   If you are a bitbucket user, you may see a slightly different url than described above.
   You may use the generic url or one that is specific to your username. For the purposes
   of an install, either will work.

3. Install satchmo into your site-packages directory::

        cd /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk
        sudo python setup.py install

.. note::
   An alternative to running the install is ensuring that /path/to/satchmo/apps is on your python path.
   You may do this by placing a symbolic link to the source, adding a .pth file that points to your /satchmo/apps
   location or modifying your PYTHONPATH environment variable.


4. Once the above step is completed, you should be able to import both django and satchmo::

        $ python
        Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Mar 12 2008, 13:39:09)
        [GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu4)] on linux2
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> import django
        >>> import satchmo_store
        >>> satchmo_store.get_version()
        '0.9-pre hg-YYYY:ZZZZZZZZZZ'

.. warning::
   Do not attempt to progress any further on the install until the above imports work.


Customizing the settings
------------------------

Now that Satchmo is installed on your PYTHONPATH, you will need to create a new project or integrate Satchmo
into an existing project. Before proceeding with the next steps, please familiarize yourself with the
sample projects, :ref:`see here for more <satchmo_sample_projects>`.

Each of these projects show examples of how to configure Satchmo and integrate it with other Django applications.
Once you are familiar with these examples, you can configure your project based on the notes below.

Additionally, there is a streamlined satchmo directory structure in the skel directory. You may use this as the
basis for your store.

You need to customize the settings.py file in mystore to include the relevant satchmo information. A sample file
called settings.py is available in the projects/base directory to act as a template. You may choose
to copy this file and use as a template for settings.py or use the notes below to configure your existing one.

Please remember to ensure that your Django database connections and settings are working properly before trying
to add any pieces of satchmo.

5. Ensure that /home/user/src/mystore/settings.py has the following satchmo-specific configurations
   (in addition to the defaults and your other app needs)::

        import os
        DIRNAME = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
        LOCAL_DEV = True

        MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'static/')
        MEDIA_URL = '/static/'

        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware",
        "threaded_multihost.middleware.ThreadLocalMiddleware",
        "satchmo_store.shop.SSLMiddleware.SSLRedirect")

        TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.path.join(DIRNAME, "templates"))
        TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS =     ('satchmo_store.shop.context_processors.settings',
                                         'django.core.context_processors.auth',
                                         )

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'satchmo_store.shop',
                'django.contrib.admin',
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.admindocs',
                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'django.contrib.comments',
                'django.contrib.sessions',
                'django.contrib.sitemaps',
                'registration',
                'keyedcache',
                'livesettings',
                'l10n',
                'sorl.thumbnail',
                'satchmo_store.contact',
                'tax',
                'tax.modules.no',
                'tax.modules.area',
                'tax.modules.percent',
                'shipping',
                'product',
                'payment',
                'payment.modules.giftcertificate',
                'satchmo_utils',
                'app_plugins',
                )

        AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
            'satchmo_store.accounts.email-auth.EmailBackend',
            'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'
            )

        #### Satchmo unique variables ####
        #from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include
        SATCHMO_SETTINGS = {
                            'SHOP_BASE' : '',
                            'MULTISHOP' : False,
                            #'SHOP_URLS' : patterns('satchmo_store.shop.views',)
                            }

        # Load the local settings
        from local_settings import *

.. note::
    In order for the admin site to work properly, you must have satchmo_store.shop placed before django.contrib.admin

6. Copy the local_settings file to mystore::

        cp /home/user/src/satchmo-trunk/satchmo/projects/base/local_settings.py /home/user/src/mystore/local_settings.py

7. You will need to verify the values assigned to the following items in local_settings.py::

        SITE_NAME
        CACHE_BACKEND
        CACHE_TIMEOUT
        SITE_DOMAIN
        LOGDIR
        LOGFILE

.. note::
    Satchmo requires that your database be able to support utf-8 characters. This is
    especially important for MySQL. If you are using MySQL, you may want to use the
    following statement in your settings file to enforce utf-8 collation::

        DATABASE_OPTIONS = {
           'init_command' : 'SET NAMES "utf8"',
           }

.. note::
    If you are using a Windows system, we recommend setting your MEDIA_ROOT using normalize_path as
    shown below::

        from satchmo_utils.thumbnail import normalize_path
        MEDIA_ROOT = normalize_path(os.path.join(DIRNAME, 'static/'))


Configure the rest of the required files
----------------------------------------

8. Next, you need to configure your urls.py file. The most simple urls.py file would look like this::

        from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
        from satchmo_store.urls import urlpatterns


9. If you have additional urls you would like to add to your project, it would look like this::

        from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
        from satchmo_store.urls import urlpatterns

        urlpatterns += patterns('',
            (r'test/', include('simple.localsite.urls'))
        )


10. Copy over the static directory::

        python manage.py satchmo_copy_static

11. Ensure that you have a template directory setup. You only need to place templates in the directory if you are
overriding existing templates.

After you have installed everything, you should have a directory structure that looks similar to this::

    mystore
        |-- __init__.py
        |-- local_settings.py
        |-- manage.py
        |-- satchmo.log
        |-- settings.py
        |-- simple.db
        |-- static
        |   |-- css
        |   |   |-- blackbird.css
        |   |   |-- jquery.autocomplete.css
        |   |   `-- style.css
        |   |-- images
        |   |   |-- blackbird_icons.png
        |   |   |-- blackbird_panel.png
        |   |   |-- productimage-picture-default.jpg
        |   |   |-- productimage-picture-default_jpg_85x85_q85.jpg
        |   |   `-- sample-logo.bmp
        |   `-- js
        |       |-- blackbird.js
        |       |-- jquery.ajaxQueue.js
        |       |-- jquery.autocomplete.js
        |       |-- jquery.bgiframe.js
        |       |-- jquery.cookie.js
        |       |-- jquery.form.js
        |       |-- jquery.js
        |       |-- satchmo_checkout.js
        |       |-- satchmo_pay_ship.js
        |       |-- satchmo_product.js
        |       `-- satchmo_store.js
        |-- templates
        `-- urls.py

Test and Install the Data
-------------------------

12. Now, you should be ready to go. In order to test your Satchmo setup, execute the following command (from the mystore directory)::

        python manage.py satchmo_check
        Checking your satchmo configuration.
        Your configuration has no errors.

13. If any errors are identified, resolve them based on the error description.

14. Sync the new satchmo tables::

        python manage.py syncdb

15. Load the country data stored in the l10n application::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_l10n

16. (Optional) Load the demo store data::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_store

17. (Optional) Load the US tax table::

        python manage.py satchmo_load_us_tax

View the Demo Store
-------------------

18.  Start up the sample webserver to see your store::

        python manage.py runserver

19.  In order to see your sample store, point your browser to::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/shop or http://127.0.0.1/

20.  If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

21.  Many configuration and customization settings are accessed through the url::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/settings

22.  Additional detailed documentation can be found here::

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/doc

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup.  If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work.  If not, use the appropriate url.

Additional Notes
----------------

Satchmo also includes a full set of unit tests. After you get your system installed, you can run the unit tests with this command::

        python manage.py test
