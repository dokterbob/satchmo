Satchmo Migrations and Upgrades
===============================

The latest list of backwards incompatible changes can always be found here-
http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges

The ideal way to migrate would be to dump all of your existing store data, remove all of your old tables, synch the new models and reload the data.
If this process is not practical, then follow the individual steps outlined below.

Always remember to do a complete backup of your store before attempting to migrate.  Additionally, we recommend that you test the migration
on a test server before attempting on a production server.

Using South
-----------

The very latest version of Satchmo includes migration files for
`South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_. So far, we only have migrations for the
``product`` app.

The instructions below assume that you have installed South 0.7; you can
download it from here:

  http://south.aeracode.org/docs/installation.html

.. Note::
   The initial product migration is based on the 0.9 code base. If you already
   have an existing installation, please read `Upgrading from an existing 0.9 installation`_;
   if you are planning to do a fresh installations of 0.9.1, please see
   `Installing Satchmo 0.9.1 with South`_.

Upgrading from an existing 0.9 installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. highlight:: console

- Download/check out a copy of the new version of Satchmo.

  .. warning:: *Do not* install the new version of Satchmo yet.

- If you aren't already using South for your project, add it to your
  ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and create the history table::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

    Syncing...

    Not synced (use migrations):
     -
    (use ./manage.py migrate to migrate these)

- Replace your Satchmo installation with the new version of it.

- Since the database tables have already been created for your old (0.9)
  Satchmo installation, you need to "fake" the initial migration, or else
  South will try re-creating the database tables. Do it like so::

    $ python manage.py migrate product --fake 0001

    - Soft matched migration 0001 to 0001_initial.

    Running migrations for product:
     - Migrating forwards to 0001_initial.
     > product: 0001_initial
       (faked)

- See list of migrations::

    $ python manage.py migrate product --list

     product
      (*) 0001_initial
      ( ) 0002_add_attributeoption
      ( ) 0003_add_productattribute_option
      ( ) 0004_remove_productattribute_name
      ( ) 0005_fix_attributeoption_error_default_spelling
      ( ) 0006_custom_textfield_add_constraint
      ( ) 0007_add_discount_valid_products_field
      ( ) 0008_remove_discount_validproducts_field
      ( ) 0009_add_categoryattributes

- Run the migrations::

    $ python manage.py migrate product --db-dry-run # db untouched
    $ python manage.py migrate product


Installing Satchmo 0.9.1 with South
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the migrations in the ``product`` app are based on v0.9, you don't have to
apply migrations from ``0001_initial`` onwards for a fresh installation - simply
let django's ``syncdb`` do it's job.

.. Note::
   We asume that you've already installed South, but have yet to take the leap
   with Satchmo; see `<http://south.aeracode.org/docs/installation.html>`_ for
   details.

- Before installing Satchmo, ensure that your tables and migrations are
  up-to-date, by running ``syncdb`` and ``migrate``.

- With Satchmo still not installed, disable South by removing/commenting it out
  from your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

- Install Satchmo by adding it to your path and ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

- Create the database tables for Satchmo's models::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

- Enable South by adding/uncommenting it from your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

- Since the database tables for Satchmo are already up-to-date, you can safely
  "fake" all the migrations in Satchmo::

    $ python manage.py migrate product --list

     product
      ( ) 0001_initial
      ( ) 0002_add_attributeoption
      ( ) 0003_add_productattribute_option
      ( ) 0004_remove_productattribute_name
      ( ) 0005_fix_attributeoption_error_default_spelling
      ( ) 0006_custom_textfield_add_constraint
      ( ) 0007_add_discount_valid_products_field
      ( ) 0008_remove_discount_validproducts_field
      ( ) 0009_add_categoryattributes
      ( ) 0010_add_discountable_categories
      ( ) 0011_split_products

    $ python manage.py migrate product --fake
    Running migrations for product:
     - Migrating forwards to 0011_split_products
     > subscription:0001_split
       (faked)
     > product:0001_initial
       (faked)
     > product:0002_add_attributeoption
       (faked)
     > product:0003_add_productattribute_option
       (faked)
     > product:0004_remove_productattribute_name
       (faked)
     > product:0005_fix_attributeoption_error_default_spelling
       (faked)
     > product:0006_custom_textfield_add_constraint
       (faked)
     > product:0007_add_discount_valid_products_field
       (faked)
     > product:0008_remove_discount_validproducts_field
       (faked)
     > product:0009_add_categoryattributes
       (faked)
     > product:0010_add_discountable_categories
       (faked)
     > downloadable:0001_split
       (faked)
     > custom:0001_split
       (faked)
     > configurable:0001_split
       (faked)
     > product:0011_split_products
       (faked)

  .. Note::
     Users familiar with the codebase may wonder why we didn't tell South to
     apply migrations for the product modules, like ``configurable`` and
     ``custom``, even though they are there; that's because they have already
     been implicitly applied. You can verify this with an installation-wide
     migration listing::

       $ python manage.py migrate --list

        product
         (*) 0001_initial
         (*) 0002_add_attributeoption
         (*) 0003_add_productattribute_option
         (*) 0004_remove_productattribute_name
         (*) 0005_fix_attributeoption_error_default_spelling
         (*) 0006_custom_textfield_add_constraint
         (*) 0007_add_discount_valid_products_field
         (*) 0008_remove_discount_validproducts_field
         (*) 0009_add_categoryattributes
         (*) 0010_add_discountable_categories
         (*) 0011_split_products

        configurable
         (*) 0001_split

        custom
         (*) 0001_split

        downloadable
         (*) 0001_split

        subscription
