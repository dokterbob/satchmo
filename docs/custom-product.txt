Custom Product Modules
======================

.. warning::
    You must be using Django revision 8032. Later revisions cause fatal errors
    with Satchmo. See `Django ticket 7947`_ for more details.

Though Satchmo includes a number of versatile product types, many projects have
needs that are best met by creating a custom product module. A custom product
module is a module with a product model which deviates from the normal behavior
of Satchmo.

To work with custom product modules, you will need a basic understanding of
Django apps, projects, and templates. You should understand the default
behavior of Satchmo before trying to customize it.

Building your module
--------------------

In a custom product module, most of the work is done in the ``models.py`` and
template files. You will also need an ``admin.py`` file and a ``config.py``
file. This section contains several example files that you can add to a new
or existing app and extend.

A basic ``models.py`` file with a custom product model looks like this::


    from django.db import models
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from satchmo.product.models import Product

    class MyNewProduct(models.Model):
        product = models.OneToOneField(Product, verbose_name=_('Product'),
            primary_key=True)

        def _get_subtype(self):
            return 'MyNewProduct'

        def __unicode__(self):
            return u"MyNewProduct: %s" % self.product.name

        class Admin:
            pass

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = _('My New Product')
            verbose_name_plural = _('My New Products')


This is the corresponding ``admin.py`` file. This file is needed to make your
models visible in Django's admin app. Make sure that you replace ``my_app``
with the name of your app::


    from django.contrib import admin
    from my_app.models import MyNewProduct # TODO: Replace app name!

    admin.site.register(MyNewProduct)


The ``config.py`` file tells Satchmo about your product model. Replace
``my_app`` here too::


    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from satchmo.configuration import config_get

    PRODUCT_TYPES = config_get('PRODUCT', 'PRODUCT_TYPES')

    # TODO: Replace app name!
    PRODUCT_TYPES.add_choice(('my_app::MyNewProduct', _('My New Product')))


Configuration
-------------

Once you've created the above three files in your app, you have all the code
necessary to use your new product model in Satchmo. All that's left is the
configuration.

1. Make sure that the app with your product model is in your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

2. Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` in your project directory.

3. Add your app name to your project's ``CUSTOM_PRODUCT_MODULES`` setting.

4. Enable the new model in Satchmo's settings.
    1. Go to "Edit Site Settings" in the admin app.
    2. Look in the "Product Settings" section and find the "Product Model Options" setting.
    3. Add your new product model and click "Save".

You can now use the new product model in the same way that you would use one
of Satchmo's default product types. You will find an "Add MyNewProduct" link in
the "Product Subtypes" section of each product's admin page.

Extending the model and templates
---------------------------------

A product model is a Django model with a ``OneToOneField`` to
``satchmo.product.models.Product`` and a ``_get_subtype`` method. You may add
new fields and behavior as you would with any other Django model.

When Satchmo renders a product page, it looks for a template named
``product/detail_productname.html`` (in all lowercase). If the template is not
found, Satchmo uses the ``base_product.html`` template.

As an example, say you are using ``MyNewProduct`` from the previous example
and you want to extend it to display a special title on the product's page.
First, you would add a ``CharField`` named ``title`` to the existing model and
to the table in your database (or just drop the table and run ``syncdb``). Then,
create a template named ``product/detail_mynewproduct.html`` with the following
content::


    {% extends "base_product.html" %}

    {% block title %}{{ product.mynewproduct.title }}{% endblock title %}


If you create a ``MyNewProduct`` and view its page in the store, the page will
have the title you assigned it in the admin app. Notice that the
``MyNewProduct`` is accessed as an attribute of ``product``.

For more examples, look at ``product/models.py``,
``templates/base_product.html``, and ``templates/product/`` in the Satchmo
source code.

Conclusion
----------

This document should get you started in customizing Satchmo through the product
model. If you need help with something discussed here or with more advanced
topics, feel free to ask the `mailing list`_.

Finally, if you create a product model that others may find useful, please
consider contributing it to the Satchmo community.
