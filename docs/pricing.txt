Pricing

Satchmo has flexible pricing that allows you to price at multiple levels.

Pricing at the Item Level
-------------------------

You can create top-level Products, which are the things your customers see on the website. (Ex: Python Rocks shirt in demo store)
Additionally, these products can have options (Ex: sizes, colors, etc).  The product has a variation for each combination of options. 
This can be used to track inventory of particular product variations. (Ex: The Large, Blue, Python Rocks Shirt)

Effectively it works like:
Product + Option = Variation

Pricing fits into the picture this way:
 * You can set a default price on your Product.
 * You can set a price adjustment for an option.
 * You can set a price over-ride for a variation.

The price code looks through these backwards. If the variation has a price then that is used
Otherwise the Product price is used +/- the adjustment for the chosen options (IE: XL shirts are +$1.00)

With this capability, you can quickly price a simple store by just using the product prices, and possibly adding price adjustments for specific options, 
but you have the option of very fine-grained price control by setting prices for each variation.

Product Variation Prices
------------------------

On the product variations, the price can have an expiration date and/or a quantity. 
If either of these fields are set then that price is only effective for orders placed before that date, or >= that quantity. 
The most specific of these gets highest priority (IE: the soonest expiration date, and the highest applicable quantity). 
This useful for running temporary promotions that automatically expire.

Expiring Pricing
----------------
If you are using expiring dates for prices, please note that you must run a daily update of the pricing lookup table.  To do this, you need to run "./manage.py satchmo_rebuild_pricing"

The easiest way to run this automatically is to add a line to your crontab::

    # run every morning at 2:22 am
    22 2 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/site/manage.py satchmo_rebuild_pricing >/dev/null 2>&1
   
Pricing Tiers
-------------

Satchmo supports setting different price and discount tiers based on user groups. The most
common reason a store owner may need this is if they want to offer different discounts or prices
for a class of user. For instance, a user with a "Gold" membership may automatically get a 
percentage discount. Another common usage is for wholesale versus retail pricing.

This feature is optional and can be enabled by following these steps:
Using it is quite simple:

    1. Add 'satchmo.product.tieredpricing' to your INSTALLED_APPS
    2. Create a user group for your desired tier.
    3. Add users to that group using the group management in the admin.
    4. Make a PricingTier, associating the group to the tier, and setting any default percentage discount.
    5. If you want specific tiered pricing for a product, then edit the product. You'll see a new section, "Tiered Prices", where you can set prices by tier.
    
The price resolution process is straightforward.

1. If the user is anonymous or has no groups, use the non-tiered price.
2. If the user has a group and that group has a tier:

  2a. Look for explicit prices (see #5 above) for that product.  If found, return it.
  
  2b. Else return the non-tiered price reduced by the default tier discount percent.
  
3. If the user has multiple tiers, return the lowest amount found in 2a & 2b.
