Quick Start
===========

For the impatient, here is the quickest way to get Satchmo installed and 
running. If you plan to use Satchmo in a production environment, then it is
important to understand the full :doc:`installation process <new_installation>`.

Install Base Requirements
-------------------------

Ensure that python 2.4 or greater installed. Mercurial must also be installed. 

Next, install `python setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ 
so that easy_install is available.

Install `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_
based on your OS.

Install pip::

    easy_install pip
    
Install Satchmo and Dependencies
--------------------------------

Execute these commands::
    
    pip install -r http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/raw/tip/scripts/requirements.txt
    pip install -e hg+http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/#egg=satchmo
    
.. Note:: This will install the latest version of satchmo from tip.

Install the Satchmo Starter App
-------------------------------

The clonesatchmo.py file should now be installed in your /bin directory. Use it to
install the Satchmo directories and load the preliminary data::

    cd /path/to/new/store
    python clonesatchmo.py
    
.. Note:: If you can not find clonesatchmo.py, it is included in the Satchmo distribution in /scripts/

Run the Development Server
--------------------------

Execute the development server command::

    cd store
    python manage.py runserver
