==================
Satchmo Change Log
==================

Trunk
-----
 * New optional app "satchmo.upsell" which allows product upselling on product detail pages.
 * New signals in get_qty_price methods of products, allowing code to manipulate the price returned
   by the function.  Example code using these signals is at satchmo.contrib.cartqty_discounts,
   which modifies the qty_discount method to calculate the discount based on the total number of items
   in the cart, rather than the total amount of the lineitem.
 * Improved inheritance of detail_producttype.html pages, which no longer need to duplicate as much of
   the code of base_product.html, allowing for easier addition of features to the product detail pages.
 * New most popular, best sellers and recently added views
 * New tiered shipping module based on quantity
 * New Fedex shipping module
