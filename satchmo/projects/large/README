This is a very basic example of a "large" Satchmo store.  Basically it has all the satchmo apps loaded, plus flatpages (built-in to Django) and Testimonials (from http://gosatchmo.com/apps/django-testimonials/)

It should work right from checkout.  Start it with "./manage.py runserver" and browse to http://localhost:8000/

Admin is:

Username: admin
Password: large
